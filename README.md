# Frontend E-Commerce Website - README

This is the README file for the frontend of the E-Commerce website. The frontend is built using React.js and is responsible for providing a user interface to interact with the backend APIs. Below, you'll find information about the project setup, dependencies, scripts, and other important details.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandymohamed/FrontEnd-React-e-commerce-.git
cd FrontEnd-React-e-commerce-
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The development server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`. The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

## Dependencies

The frontend project relies on the following dependencies:

- `@hookform/resolvers`: Library for managing form validations with React Hook Form.
- `@paypal/react-paypal-js`: React wrapper for integrating PayPal payments.
- `@reduxjs/toolkit`: Redux toolkit for efficient state management.
- `@testing-library/jest-dom`: Testing utilities for Jest.
- `@testing-library/react`: React testing utilities for Jest.
- `@testing-library/user-event`: Utility library for simulating user events in tests.
- `axios`: Library for making HTTP requests from the browser.
- `bootstrap`: CSS framework for styling components.
- `react`: React library for building user interfaces.
- `react-bootstrap`: React implementation of Bootstrap components.
- `react-bootstrap-typeahead`: React typeahead component for selecting options.
- `react-dom`: Entry point for working with the DOM in React applications.
- `react-helmet`: React library for managing document head tags.
- `react-hook-form`: Library for managing form state and validations in React.
- `react-icons`: Library of icons for React applications.
- `react-paypal-button-v2`: PayPal button component for React applications.
- `react-redux`: Official React bindings for Redux state management.
- `react-router-dom`: Library for handling routing in React applications.
- `react-scripts`: Configuration and scripts for React applications.
- `redux`: Library for managing application state.
- `redux-devtools-extension`: Redux DevTools extension for debugging Redux state changes.

- `npm build`: Builds the production-ready bundle.
- `npm test`: Runs tests using Jest.
- `npm eject`: Ejects the app from Create React App configuration.

## ESLint Configuration

The ESLint configuration extends the default configuration for Create React App and Jest, providing code linting for the project.

## Browserslist

The `browserslist` section in the `package.json` file specifies the supported browsers for production and development environments.

## Development Dependencies

The `node-sass` package is used as a development dependency for compiling SCSS stylesheets.

Feel free to explore the codebase, make changes, and customize the frontend as needed. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to contribute to the project or open an issue.
